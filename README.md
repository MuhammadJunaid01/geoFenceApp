### Notes

- Make sure **Location Permissions** are always granted for the app to function properly.
- High accuracy mode allows the app to use GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks for precise location tracking.

## Step 4: Using the GeoFenceApp

### View Your Location

- Upon opening the app, the map will center on your **current location** if location permissions are granted.
- If the map does not center, ensure that:
  - **Location Permissions** are enabled.
  - **GPS** is active on your device.

### Create a GeoFence

1. Tap the **"Add New Map"** button to begin creating a new geofence.
2. **Draw the geofence boundary** by selecting points on the map to define the area.
3. **Save the geofence** by providing a name or identifier for the geofence.

### View Saved GeoFences

- Your **saved geofences** will be displayed as highlighted polygons on the map.

---

### Notes

- Ensure that your **device's GPS** is properly configured for accurate location tracking.
- Saved geofences will persist in the app, allowing you to manage them as needed.

## Step 5: Update the App

To get the latest version of the app, follow these steps:

1. **Repeat Step 1** to download the latest `.apk` file from GitHub Actions.
2. **Install the new `.apk` file** over the existing version on your device.

   - When prompted, confirm that you want to **replace the existing app** with the new version.
   - The app data and settings should remain intact after the update.

---

### Notes

- Always ensure you have the **latest version** for bug fixes, new features, and improvements.
- If you encounter any issues with the update, try uninstalling the previous version before installing the new one.

## Optimizations

### Performance Improvements

GeoFenceApp is an application that allows users to manage geofences on a map. This app offers functionality like creating, viewing, and managing geofences, as well as tracking location.

## Optimizations

The app has undergone several optimizations to enhance performance, user experience, and resource management. Here are the key optimizations made:

### 2. Efficient State Management

Unnecessary state updates and re-renders were minimized by utilizing memoization techniques like `useMemo` and `React.memo`, as well as appropriate use of React hooks. These optimizations ensure that the app remains responsive and minimizes performance bottlenecks, particularly for components that don't need frequent updates. This results in smoother interactions, especially on lower-end devices.

---

These optimizations contribute to a better user experience by reducing load times, improving responsiveness, and making the app more efficient overall.
